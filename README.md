**Architectural Breakdown**  
**Customizable AI-Based Cybersecurity Incident Readiness and Response Plan SaaS Tool \- (A Digital Genome® project)**

**1\. Overview**  
The AI-Based Cybersecurity Incident Readiness and Response Plan tool is designed as a highly customizable, modular system that leverages the General Theory of Information (GTI) to create a self-regulating, adaptive cybersecurity solution. The system integrates multiple AI agents, a knowledge graph, and a comprehensive configuration layer, allowing businesses to tailor the tool to their specific needs and address all aspects of cybersecurity requirements.

**2\. Core Architectural Components**  
**2.1 Customization Layer (Preliminary Configuration)**

* **Business Profiling Module:** Gathers information regarding the business type, operations, hierarchy, compliance needs, past cybersecurity events, risk appetite, etc. This information is used to customize every other component of the system to align with the specific business context.  
* **Interactive Questionnaire:** An interface that asks detailed questions about business operations, regulatory requirements, existing tools, vulnerabilities, and corporate governance.  
* **Risk Assessment Module:** Analyzes collected information to create a risk profile that determines priorities in the incident response plan.  
* **Framework Recommendation Module**: Recommends specific security frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, CIS) based on the gathered data.  
* **Customization Output:** Configures incident playbooks, policies, and security settings tailored to the organization's needs.

**2.2 AI Agents (Microservices Architecture)**

* **OSINT Analyst Agent:** Collects real-time information about emerging threats from open-source intelligence (blogs, forums, news, etc.).  
* **Tools:** WebSearchTool and WebScraperTool for extracting and analyzing relevant cybersecurity data.  
* **Validation Agent:** Verifies the accuracy and relevance of information gathered by the OSINT Analyst Agent.  
* **Role:** Ensures that intelligence meets quality standards before adding it to the knowledge base.  
* **Knowledge Graph Agent:** Creates and maintains a knowledge graph of cybersecurity threats, linking threat actors, vulnerabilities, tactics, and other related entities.  
* **Database:** Uses Neo4j to manage relationships among entities in the knowledge graph.

**2.3 Autopoietic and Cognitive Management**

* **Autopoietic Network Manager (APM):** Utilizes Kubernetes for provisioning, managing, and self-healing containerized microservices.  
* **Function**: Handles scalability, failover, and container lifecycle management.  
* **Docker Container Management**: Each AI agent operates within its own container, which is dynamically managed based on system needs.  
* **Cognitive Network Manager (CNM):** Orchestrates data flows and manages interactions between microservices to maintain efficient operations.  
* **Dynamic Workflow Management**: Uses policies derived from GTI to optimize data flow and dynamically manage workflows.

**2.4 Knowledge Graph and Long-Term Memory**\*\*

* **Knowledge Graph Integration:** **Neo4j** graph database maintains a real-time representation of the cybersecurity knowledge base, including entities such as threat actors, vulnerabilities, and relationships among them.  
* **Associative Memory and Event History:** All interactions are stored, forming an evolving history of events used to enhance system learning and adaptiveness.  
* **Event-Driven Associative Memory**: Maintains an event-driven history of all system interactions, creating long-term associative memory that aids in optimizing response strategies.

**2.5 Microservices Design**

* **Containerized Services**: Each AI agent runs as an independent microservice within a Docker container.  
* **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Used to manage and scale the microservices infrastructure, providing high availability and fault tolerance.  
* **API Gateway:** Routes requests to relevant microservices while handling authentication, rate limiting, and aggregation.

**2.6 Adaptive Security Framework Recommendation** 

* **Adaptive Engine:** Suggests optimal security frameworks and action plans based on the business profile and current risk landscape.  
* **Integration with Customization Layer:** Uses the information gathered during customization to recommend frameworks like ISO 27001 or CIS, adjusting for specific industry needs.

**2.7 Incident Detection and Response Module**

* **Incident Detection:** AI agents continuously monitor the environment, collecting and analyzing data for potential threats.  
* **Incident Playbook Generation:** Tailored playbooks are generated based on detected incidents, the company’s structure, compliance requirements, and risk tolerance.  
* **Containment and Recovery:** Guidance on isolation, recovery, and root cause analysis based on previous incidents and the knowledge graph.
